## Building an EV Battery Monitoring solution with AWS IoT FleetWise (Part 2/2)

This repository contains resources for the [blog post of the same name](TBD).

Please follow the following instructions.

1. Install and bootstrap the CDK:

   ```bash
   npm install -g aws-cdk
   # replace PROFILE_NAME with your specific AWS CLI profile that has username and region defined
   export CDK_DEPLOY_ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --profile PROFILE_NAME --query Account --output text)
   # Set REGION to where the bootstrap resources will be deployed
   export CDK_DEPLOY_REGION=eu-central-1
   # replace PROFILE_NAME with your specific AWS CLI profile that has username and region defined
   cdk bootstrap aws://$CDK_DEPLOY_ACCOUNT/$CDK_DEPLOY_REGION
   ```

1. Clone the repository, change into the `evbatterymonitoring/` directory to build and deploy the CloudFormation stack:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iot-fleetwise-evbatterymonitoring.git
   cd cloud/batteryhealthmonitoring/
   npm install
   npm run build
   cdk deploy
   ```
